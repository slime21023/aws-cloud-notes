# Cost optimization

The Cost Optimization pillar includes the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

### Design principles

* **Implement Cloud Financial Management**: To achieve financial success and accelerate business value realization in the cloud, invest in Cloud Financial Management and Cost Optimization.
  * Your organization should dedicate time and resources to build capability in this new domain of technology and usage management.
  * Similar to your Security or Operational Excellence capability, you need to build capability through knowledge building, programs, resources, and processes to become a cost-efficient organization.

* **Adopt a consumption model**: Pay only for the computing resources that you require and increase or decrease usage depending on business requirements, not by using elaborate forecasting. 
  * For example, development and test environments are typically only used for eight hours a day during the work week. 
  * You can stop these resources when they are not in use for a potential cost savings of 75% (40 hours versus 168 hours).
* **Measure overall efficiency**:  Measure the business output of the workload and the costs associated with delivering it. Use this measure to know the gains you make from increasing output and reducing costs.
* **Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting**: AWS does the heavy lifting of data center operations like racking, stacking, and powering servers.
  * It also removes the operational burden of managing operating systems and applications with managed services.
  * This permits you to focus on your customers and business projects rather than on IT infrastructure.
* **Analyze and attribute expenditure**: The cloud makes it simple to accurately identify the usage and cost of systems, which then permits transparent attribution of IT costs to individual workload owners.
  * This helps measure return on investment (ROI) and gives workload owners an opportunity to optimize their resources and reduce costs.
